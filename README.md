# Observation
Given the significant class imbalance in the dataset, each model faced notable difficulties in accurately predicting instances belonging to the positive class. This imbalance skewed predictions towards the majority class, affecting the models' ability to correctly identify instances where the outcome was positive. This observation was consistent across all models evaluated, highlighting the ongoing challenge posed by class imbalance in predictive modeling tasks.
